Ref from G+
> Ater upgrading to AS 0.5.4 I am getting this error "Failed to set up SDK
    Error:Module 'AndroinoTerm': platform 'android-18' not found" while I already have android-18 installed. My sdk path is correctly setup and I am also able to run my project successfully. Does Anybody else having this issue ?
    
Solution:
    1. Change sdk folder location
    2. update sdk path in android studio
    3. change back to original location
    4. update sdk path setting in android studio again
    5. problem solved
